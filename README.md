# Simple Bank Service

## The service that  build is a simple bank. It will provide APIs for the frontend to do following things:

### 1) Create and manage bank accounts, which are composed of owner’s name, balance, and currency.
+
### 2) Record all balance changes to each of the account. So every time some money is added to or subtracted from the account, an account entry record will be created.
+
### 3) Perform a money transfer between 2 accounts. This should happen within a transaction, so that either both accounts’ balance are updated successfully or none of them are.
